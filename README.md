Since I was forced to migrate to Windows from Linux (where life was so much easier), I faced some troubles when using my ordinary toolset: vim + you_complete_me; .ycm_extra_conf.py working extremely slowly.
So I've created this rought script, that utilize msbuild.exe output to create compile_commands.json with define directives and include directories. Firstly it lookups for existing _vcxproj_ in current dirrectory, or create one if exist Qt's _pro_ file, than builds project (means, that if project doesnt build, no compilation database will be created) sadly, but msbuild still doesnt have dry-run.
